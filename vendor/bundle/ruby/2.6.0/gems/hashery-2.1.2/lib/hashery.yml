version: 2.1.2
summary: Facets-bread collection of Hash-like classes.
description: The Hashery is a tight collection of Hash-like classes. Included among
  its many offerings are the auto-sorting Dictionary class, the efficient LRUHash,
  the flexible OpenHash and the convenient KeyHash. Nearly every class is a subclass
  of the CRUDHash which defines a CRUD model on top of Ruby's standard Hash making
  it a snap to subclass and augment to fit any specific use case.
