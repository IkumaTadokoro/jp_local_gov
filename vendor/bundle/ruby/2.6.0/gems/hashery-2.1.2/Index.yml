  Hashery

summary:
  Facets-bread collection of Hash-like classes.

description:
  The Hashery is a tight collection of Hash-like classes. Included among its many
  offerings are the auto-sorting Dictionary class, the efficient LRUHash, the
  flexible OpenHash and the convenient KeyHash. Nearly every class is a subclass
  of the CRUDHash which defines a CRUD model on top of Ruby's standard Hash
  making it a snap to subclass and augment to fit any specific use case.
